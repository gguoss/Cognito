## The Great Consensus: The Mechanical Heart

Consensus refers to how all participants reach an agreement on a specific issue.

Historically, consensus that propelled the advancement of human civilization primarily relied on human subjectivity, such as the Hundred Schools of Thought, religions, and Marxism. However, in the information age, with the explosion of data, the limited processing capacity of the human brain struggles to cope with increasingly complex situations and form effective consensus through traditional social discourse.

This is where "Mechanical Consensus" emerges. It doesn't rely on direct human participation but instead utilizes automated machine game theory to form a consensus that addresses the needs of human civilization. The Bitcoin network is a successful example of mechanical consensus, demonstrating its ability to adapt, grow, and become more stable and secure.

This self-evolving mechanical consensus, capable of adapting to the information age, is hailed as the "Great Consensus of the Information Age," poised to lead future societal development. The ever-increasing torrent of information necessitates the creation of a great mechanical consensus to guide humanity in addressing the consensus challenges brought about by the explosive growth of technology.

The essence of Bitcoin lies in its adaptive mechanical consensus, akin to the human "heart," serving as the core of its control and operation. Drawing an analogy between human functions and the Bitcoin system:

* **Heart:**  Equates to the adaptive mechanical consensus, the core controlling the system's operation.
* **Brain:**  Equates to the smart contract platform, responsible for computation and execution.
* **Senses:** Equates to the communication mechanism, responsible for information transmission.

Past public blockchains have overemphasized the pursuit of computational power, neglecting the central role of the consensus mechanism. Just like in humans, the "heart" is the key to determining direction and action, not just the computational power of the "brain."

Although Satoshi Nakamoto has disappeared, the Bitcoin system he proposed, with its core "Mechanical Heart" – the adaptive mechanical consensus – continues to operate and evolve, guiding the development of the entire crypto industry.

## The Origin and Development of Consensus

In early human history, people gathered for survival, forming a primitive consensus based on collective defense, food distribution, and the division of labor. As society developed, the emergence of the social contract theory attributed the formation of consensus to individual rationality, the spirit of contract, and the constraints of rules, laying the foundation for modern social systems.

However, the advent of the information age brought an unprecedented flood of information, rendering traditional consensus methodologies obsolete. Consequently, Mechanical Consensus emerged, which doesn't rely on humans but instead allows machines to independently form consensus based on complex information. For instance, the Bitcoin network utilizes a computational power competition to maintain system security.

As an emerging form of consensus, Mechanical Consensus will play a crucial role in the information age and deserves our in-depth research.

## Bitcoin Consensus

Bitcoin's consensus mechanism ingeniously combines a computational power competition with economic incentives, achieving self-reinforcement and continuous growth. Miners, driven by the reward of Bitcoin, continuously invest computational power in mining, creating a never-ending competition. This is akin to an "infinite computational power race game," where miners fiercely compete, striving to win rewards by outperforming each other in computational power.

To maintain network stability, the Bitcoin network dynamically adjusts mining difficulty based on the total network computational power. The higher the computational power, the greater the mining difficulty, implying more miners participating in the competition, greater computational power invested, higher network security, and thus stronger Bitcoin consensus.

This mechanism forms a virtuous cycle: 

> more miners participate -> increased network computational power -> increased mining difficulty -> enhanced consensus -> increased Bitcoin value -> attracting more miners to participate... 

This cycle repeats endlessly, ensuring the security, stability, and sustainable development of the Bitcoin network.

More importantly, the Bitcoin network pioneered "Mechanical Consensus," which does not rely on any centralized institution or human intervention. It operates entirely based on code and algorithms, automatically achieving and maintaining consensus. This is the first self-growing mechanical consensus in human civilization, marking the most revolutionary innovation of blockchain technology.

Essentially, Bitcoin's consensus mechanism is a never-ending computational power race. Miners are forced to continuously invest computational power to compete for Bitcoin rewards, making Bitcoin's consensus increasingly robust.

### Mechanical Consensus: A Branch of Cybernetics

Cybernetics studies the control and communication of systems (such as machines, organisms, or societies), with feedback as its core concept. This means the system adjusts itself based on the results of its actions, ultimately achieving goals or maintaining stability.

Mechanical consensus can be seen as a branch of cybernetics, studying how machine systems achieve consistency through interaction. For example, how multiple robots collaborate to complete a task, or how a distributed computer network reaches consensus on a particular issue, all fall under the scope of mechanical consensus research.

The Bitcoin network is a prime example of mechanical consensus. It consists of a large number of independently operating computer nodes that communicate with each other through preset rules and protocols, jointly maintaining a secure and decentralized ledger. The operating mechanism of the Bitcoin network embodies the following characteristics of mechanical consensus:

* **Decentralization:** No central authority; all nodes participate in the decision-making process.
* **Autonomy:** The system operates automatically based on preset rules, without human intervention.
* **Consistency:** All nodes ultimately reach consensus on the state of the ledger.

Specific mechanisms within the Bitcoin network, such as Proof of Work (PoW) and the difficulty adjustment mechanism, are designed to achieve mechanical consensus. These mechanisms ensure that the Bitcoin network can operate securely and stably without central coordination.

In conclusion, mechanical consensus is an important branch of cybernetics, and Bitcoin is a successful application of it. It demonstrates how machine systems can achieve self-organization and collaboration without central control.

### Bitcoin's Adaptive Mechanical Consensus: Expressing the Core of Wiener's Cybernetics

The core ideas of Wiener's cybernetics - self-organizing systems, nonlinear systems, and the exploration of the essence of life - are closely linked to the operating mechanism of Bitcoin. Bitcoin's decentralization, consensus mechanism, and adaptability embody the characteristics of self-organizing systems. Its network effects and emergent behavior also exhibit the complexity of nonlinear systems.

Furthermore, "Mechanical Consensus" is precisely the mechanical expression of the unity of the three concepts proposed by Wiener. The operating mechanism of the Bitcoin network perfectly embodies the high degree of unity among self-organizing systems, nonlinear systems, and the exploration of the essence of life.

Viewing Bitcoin as "mechanical life" implies that the Bitcoin network, with "mechanical consensus" as its soul, possesses self-awareness and evolutionary capabilities similar to living organisms. It pioneers a decentralized, transparent, and secure way of transferring value, holding profound significance for the development of human information civilization.

### Why is Only Bitcoin Consensus Adaptively Growing?

Bitcoin's consensus mechanism has a unique adaptive growth characteristic, meaning its security dynamically increases with the growth of computational power. This contrasts sharply with the consensus mechanisms of other cryptocurrencies:

* **PoS Mechanism:**  Like Ethereum, its security relies on the number of staked tokens. Due to the limited total amount of tokens, there is an upper limit to its security.
* **Other PoW Mechanisms:** Under BTC-type PoW mechanisms, the strong get stronger. Bitcoin, with its first-mover advantage and network effects, wins the computational power competition, making its PoW mechanism more adaptive. Other altcoins lack this advantage, their computational power is squeezed by Bitcoin, and they struggle to achieve the full "adaptability" of the PoW mechanism.

Bitcoin's adaptive growth characteristics stem from the following factors:

* **Dynamic Adjustment of Computational Power and Difficulty:** Difficulty adjusts according to changes in computational power, ensuring network security and stability.
* **Profit-Seeking Nature of Miners:** Higher computational power brings higher returns, incentivizing miners to continuously invest.
* **Halving Mechanism:** Controls Bitcoin output, pushing up prices, and further incentivizing miner participation.

Satoshi Nakamoto's combination of Moore's Law and the halving mechanism may be aimed at achieving long-term sustainability and ensuring network security and decentralization.

### Expression of Bitcoin's Adaptive Mechanical Consensus

* **UTXO Carrier:**  Unspent Transaction Output, the fundamental unit of Bitcoin ownership.
* **Script:**  Stack-based language for expressing transaction conditions.
* **State Change:**  The process of updating the Bitcoin ledger through transactions.
