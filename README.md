## The Great Consensus: The Mechanical Heart

Consensus refers to how all participants reach an agreement on a specific issue.

Historically, consensus that propelled the advancement of human civilization primarily relied on human subjectivity, such as the Hundred Schools of Thought, religions, and Marxism. However, in the information age, with the explosion of data, the limited processing capacity of the human brain struggles to cope with increasingly complex situations and form effective consensus through traditional social discourse.

This is where "Mechanical Consensus" emerges. It doesn't rely on direct human participation but instead utilizes automated machine game theory to form a consensus that addresses the needs of human civilization. The Bitcoin network is a successful example of mechanical consensus, demonstrating its ability to adapt, grow, and become more stable and secure.

This self-evolving mechanical consensus, capable of adapting to the information age, is hailed as the "Great Consensus of the Information Age," poised to lead future societal development. The ever-increasing torrent of information necessitates the creation of a great mechanical consensus to guide humanity in addressing the consensus challenges brought about by the explosive growth of technology.

The essence of Bitcoin lies in its adaptive mechanical consensus, akin to the human "heart," serving as the core of its control and operation. Drawing an analogy between human functions and the Bitcoin system:

* **Heart:**  Equates to the adaptive mechanical consensus, the core controlling the system's operation.
* **Brain:**  Equates to the smart contract platform, responsible for computation and execution.
* **Senses:** Equates to the communication mechanism, responsible for information transmission.

Past public blockchains have overemphasized the pursuit of computational power, neglecting the central role of the consensus mechanism. Just like in humans, the "heart" is the key to determining direction and action, not just the computational power of the "brain."

Although Satoshi Nakamoto has disappeared, the Bitcoin system he proposed, with its core "Mechanical Heart" – the adaptive mechanical consensus – continues to operate and evolve, guiding the development of the entire crypto industry.

## The Origin and Development of Consensus

In early human history, people gathered for survival, forming a primitive consensus based on collective defense, food distribution, and the division of labor. As society developed, the emergence of the social contract theory attributed the formation of consensus to individual rationality, the spirit of contract, and the constraints of rules, laying the foundation for modern social systems.

However, the advent of the information age brought an unprecedented flood of information, rendering traditional consensus methodologies obsolete. Consequently, Mechanical Consensus emerged, which doesn't rely on humans but instead allows machines to independently form consensus based on complex information. For instance, the Bitcoin network utilizes a computational power competition to maintain system security.

As an emerging form of consensus, Mechanical Consensus will play a crucial role in the information age and deserves our in-depth research.
